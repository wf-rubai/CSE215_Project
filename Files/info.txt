Welcome, Traveler, to our project. The traveler, who can readily identify hotels in 
various Bangladeshi areas, is the primary target audience for this project. Among 
the various features included in this project are a search bar, hotel symbols, hotel 
listings and ratings. A login panel, profile, update profile, settings panel, hotel 
search and booking, cost per day calculation, and—most importantly—the creation of 
an additional framework for the developers are the features we have in our project. 
The developer site allows us to add new hotels, modify existing ones, alter their 
prices, update user and hotel information, delete existing hotels, and more. Travelers 
who intend to travel with their loved ones would profit from this initiative.
